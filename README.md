A simple compiler and interpreter written in Python, capable of parsing, analyzing, and executing a custom programming language with basic arithmetic, control flow, and variable assignments.

Features
Lexer: Tokenizes source code into tokens (e.g., integers, floats, identifiers, keywords, operators).
Parser: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens, preparing for structured code execution.
Interpreter: Evaluates the AST, supporting arithmetic operations, loops, conditions, and assignments.
Debug Mode: Enables a detailed view of tokens and AST nodes for debugging and understanding the code execution flow.
